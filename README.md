# Alarm clock

My approach was simple 
first, get the current time and display it to the document(window) by ID
then set 1 second so the current time updates after every second
while the current time is updating I took some input from the user for exp: (Hour: Minutes: period).
next, By conditional statement check if they match ring the alarm, and if the user wants to cancel the alarm, there is also a cancel button too.
If the cancel button is clicked the sound is paused and user input data is set to 0.
